# Hometown Connections

Welcome to the repository for the code that powers the website of Hometown Connections. This README provides an overview of the code structure and highlights how I've made it easy to replicate new pages for different expos and events.  

## Code Structure  

This website is organized with scalability and flexibility in mind. Here's an overview of the key components:  

- **templates:** The template is designed to be modular and reusable. Each event page has its own template, making it straightforward to create new pages by duplicating an existing template and customizing it as needed.  

- **css:** CSS stylesheets are organized to maintain consistency and can be selectively included in event-specific pages.  


## Creating New Event Pages  

I've designed the code to simplify the process of creating new event pages:  

- **Duplicate an Existing Template:** To create a new event page, start by duplicating the existing template. Name it appropriately to reflect the event.  

- **Customize Content:** Customize the content within the duplicated template to match the specifics of the event, including event details, schedules, speakers, and any other relevant information.  

- **Styling Options:** Depending on the event's branding, you can include event-specific styles by linking to a custom stylesheet within the appropriate css directory.  

*This project was already finished before I made the Github repository. I have not used Github much in the past because I have always worked by myself. However, I will be adding projects in the future to display that I do in fact know how to properly use git.
